## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to my journey in solving competitive programming problems. Each solution is implemented in C++ or python and is thoroughly tested. The aim is to not only provide correct solutions but also to share efficient and well-documented code that others can learn from.

## Platform Breakdown
I have tackled problems from the following platforms:
- **[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)**: Various domains including algorithms, data structures, and more.
- **[CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)**: Monthly contests and practice problems.
- **[CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/)**: A wide range of problems covering fundamental algorithms and data structures.
- **[GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)**: Extensive problem sets and tutorials.
- **[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)**: Regular contests and a vast problem archive.
